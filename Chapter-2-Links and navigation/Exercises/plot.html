		<h2>Reviews</h2>
		<p>"Split is a great movie of how the mind works or how it fails to work.  It explains the different ways or maybe more accurately weird ways people see and interpret things.  To one a person is a caring loving person while to others he's a socialist traitor to the American way and a threat to our freedom. The dissociative identity disorder shows the power of the mind and how it changes a person within. " - Google review</p>
		<p>"Split serves as a dramatic tour de force for James McAvoy in multiple roles." - Rotten tomatoes.com</p>
